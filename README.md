## Data Storage

ArchiveCol combines the power of both online and local storage to provide a seamless and robust data storage solution. The app utilizes Firebase, a highly reliable and scalable cloud-based platform, for storing and synchronizing data across multiple devices. This ensures that your collection data is securely backed up and readily accessible from anywhere.

Additionally, ArchiveCol leverages local storage on the user's device, enabling offline functionality and enhanced performance. Your collection data is cached locally, allowing you to view and manage your items even when you're offline or experiencing a weak internet connection.

By seamlessly integrating Firebase's cloud storage capabilities with the efficiency of local storage, ArchiveCol ensures that your collection data is both securely stored in the cloud and available offline whenever you need it. This combination of online and local storage provides a truly amazing and reliable data storage experience for users.
